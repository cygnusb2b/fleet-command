Fleet Command
==========

Fleet Command is a mission log application for spaceship commanders. This project is to be used as a test of skills for debugging and developing within the Symfony PHP and Ember JS frameworks.

Please review the [wiki](https://github.com/cygnusb2b/fleet-command/wiki) for instructions on connecting to or setting up an environment to work through the scenarios in this repository.
  
## Scenarios
There are several issues with this repository. Each of them are listed below. For each issue, determine the root cause and commit a fix to your fork of this repository.

1. **Sign In link is broken**: When I try to click sign in to update my mission logs, an error is displayed.
2. **Forgot my credentials :(**: I seem to have forgotten my username and password for Fleet Commander. Can you tell me what they are? I remember we use Symfony's [security configuration](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html), but I can't remember how to login.
3. **Javascript error when viewing mission logs**: When attempting to load my mission logs after logging in, nothing shows up on the page. In the browser console, I see an error.
4. **Javascript error when creating a log**: When I try to create a new mission log, a Javascript error shows up and my log isn't saved.

## Submission
Once you have completed all scenarios, contact developer@southcomm.com and include your Github username. In order to ensure a fair testing experience for all users, please **do not** push any of your changes to your fork -- we will review the git history and your environment on the server.
